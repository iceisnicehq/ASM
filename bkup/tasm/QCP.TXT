*
* ^F9 is our "Compile" macro
*
*  Note that this macro causes the the Output file name ($O) to be ERRORS.LST
*  in the current directory, and the Macro file name ($M) to be ERRORS.MAC,
*  also in the current directory.  This is forced via the /M and /O command
*  line switches.
*
*  If you have a RAM disk, you will probably want to edit this macro
*  (and/or change the ..O and ..M values in your QCP.DAT) to locate these
*  files on the RAM disk for faster operation.  If you configure QCP
*  properly, making sure the filenames used for $O and $M are always the
*  same as those referenced in this macro, then you can remove the /O and
*  /M options below, saving some space here (since QCONFIG has a limited
*  space for macros).
