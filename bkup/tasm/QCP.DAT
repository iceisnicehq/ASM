===========================================================================

COMMENTS:

File extensions must begin in the 1st column, with a period.
Lines not beginning with a period, or less than 5 chars long are ignored.
Up to 10 extensions may be specified.  Any more will be ignored.
There must be at least 1 space between the file extension and the command line.

The following substitution strings can be put into the command line:
    $F      fully qualified drive/path name of the target file.  Includes
            drive letter and a full path from the root.
    $D      drive letter of the target file.  One char, does not include ':'.
    $P      full path specification to target file.  Includes a '\' as
            the first character, but no trailing '\' is included.
    $N      8-character name of the file.
    $E      3-character extension of the file.  No '.' included.
    $#      where # is a single digit from 1 to 9, is substituted for
            additional params on the QCP command line.
    $$      puts a single '$' on the target command line.
    $T      is the name of the Temp file used by QCP.
    $O      is the name of the Output file.
    $M      is the name of the binary Macro file created by QMAC
            from the temp file written by QCP.

Within this file, some pseudo-ops are also recognized, in addition to the
normal file extension definitions:
    ..T     sets the name of the Temp file used by QCP to build QEdit macros
    ..O     sets the name of the Output file created by the redirected
            messages of your compiler and read by QMAC.
    ..M     sets the name of the binary Macro file to be created by QMAC.
    ..Q     sets the Qedit macro template.  If error messages from the compiler
            exist, macros fitting this form will be generated.
    ..Q ON  is an alternate form, that simply reactivates macro generation
            in a copy of QCP.EXE in which it has been turned off.
    ..Q OFF deactivates macro generation.
    ..C     sets the QMAC Command line to be executed if macros
            need to be created
    ..#     where # is a single digit from 1 to 9, is just like a
            file extension definition, but these command lines
            correspond to the /1 through /9 command line options
            recognized by QCP itself.  See QCP.DOC for examples
            on how to use this.  This pretty much assumes that macro
            generation is turned on, at least to be truly useful.
    ..B     is the batch mode startup macro template.
    ..G ON  sets the default for "guess file extensions"
    ..W ON  sets the default for "rewrite error file"
    ..N     is the "next error" macro template.
    ..P     is the "previous error" macro template.

Some extra $x substitutions exist for use in the above pseudo-ops, in
addition to the ones defined earlier:
    $K      is the Key number for the QEdit macro.  If the macro
            definition begins with "@$K", then this number will
            range from 1 to 9, and then 0, to assign the
            Alt-numeric keys.  For any other macro template, $K
            will range from 1 to 12, to assign function keys.
    $S      is the Source line number reported by your compiler
    $R      is the Result line number, the line in the Output
            file on which the error MESSAGE occurred.
    $C      is the Column number reported by your compiler, corresponds
            with the location indicated by $S.
    $I      is the inserted character used when rewriting the error file
            See documentation for details.
    $U      is the unique string for this compiler
    $L      is the leadin string for this compiler
