QUESTION:   I try to use the "*","-", and "+" key on my numeric keypad and it
doesn't seem to work.

ANSWER:     By default QEdit has the Paste, Cut, and Copy commands assigned to
these keys. They are referred to as the "grey*", "grey-", and "grey+" keys. If
you want to use these keys at "Face-value", then unassign them in your
keyboard definition file. See the printed manual for a listing of these keys.


QUESTION:   I have a NorthGate keyboard that has an additional "*" key, but it
doesn't seem to work.

ANSWER:     This extra "*" key is the same as the "grey*" key. Please see the
previous Question and Answer.


QUESTION:   I can't get the F11 and F12 keys to work.

ANSWER:     The F11 and F12 keys are present on "Enhanced Keyboards", also
known as the 101-key keyboards.

By default, QEdit has enhanced keyboard testing turned off. Run Qconfig.exe,
select Advanced options, and answer Yes to "Test for presence of enhanced
keyboard (Y/N)? ". Be sure that you Save your changes when you quit
Qconfig.exe. As long as you have an "Enhanced Keyboard" and also a Rom Bios
that recognizes the Enhanced keyboard, you will be able to use these
additional keys. For a list of the "Enhanced Keyboard" keys, see the printed
manual.


QUESTION:   My TSR will not pop up over QEdit, why?

ANSWER:     Some TSR's will not pop-up when Enhanced keyboard calls are being
made. Run Qconfig.exe, select Advanced options, and answer NO to "Test for
presence of enhanced keyboard (Y/N)? ". Be sure that you Save your changes
when you quit Qconfig.exe. This should allow your TSR to pop-up. If you have
Enhanced Keyboard testing turned off, you will not be able to access commands
that you have assigned to the F11, F12, and other enhanced keys. For a list of
the Enhanced keyboard keys, see the printed manual.


QUESTION:   My Tab key doesn't seem to work right. What is wrong?

ANSWER:     It's possible that you have ToggleSmartTabs ON. Make sure that
ToggleSmartTabs is OFF.  Please see the printed manual for a description of
the ToggleSmartTabs command.


 TEXT ENTRY AND MANIPULATION:

QUESTION:   How can I enter _ANY_ ASCII character in QEdit?

ANSWER:     Any ASCII character having a decimal value of 0-255 can be entered
into a text file while in QEdit using one of the following methods:

                                ASCII 1-255:

Press and hold the <ALT> key. Now, using the numeric keypad (this is the
keypad that is usually located on the right hand side of the keyboard), type
the decimal value of the Ascii character that you want. Now release the <ALT>
key and you should have the character placed in your text. (If you have a
problem entering an ASCII 240, see the discussion in this section.)

                                  ASCII 0:

To enter the NULL character (Ascii 0) into your text, first use QEdit's
literal command (our default <CTRL P> ) and then press <CTRL @>. You will get
the NULL character placed in your text (it will look like a space).

For more information on the Alt numeric keypad see the QEdit tip on page 1-26
of the printed manual. For more information on the Literal command see the
printed manual.


QUESTION:   How can I change a lower case character to an Upper case one or
Vice-versa?

ANSWER:     QEdit has 3 case changing commands. They are Upper, Lower, and
Flip. These commands can be used to force uppercase, lowercase, or togglecase
at the cursor position OR on all characters in a marked block (if the cursor
is within the marked block).


QUESTION:   How can I enter page breaks into my text?

ANSWER:     You can enter a Form-feed character into your text by using the
Literal command (our default <CTRL P> ) followed by <CTRL L>. You can also use
the Alt-numeric keypad method (described previously). Hold the <ALT> key and
type 12 on the numeric keypad, then release the <ALT> key.


QUESTION:   I am writing batch files and QEdit puts a carriage return/line
feed on the last line of a file. How can I keep from getting the double Dos
prompt when my batch file is done?

ANSWER:     QEdit writes a carriage return/line feed pair at the end of each
line whenever a file is saved. If you don't want the carriage return/line feed
on the last line of a batch file to be "SEEN" by Dos, then enter a Ctrl Z as
the last character on the last line. Dos will stop processing the batch file
when the ctrl Z is reached so you won't get the double prompt.


QUESTION:   How do I enter a NULL character into my text?

ANSWER:     Use QEdit's Literal command (our default <CTRL P>) immediately
followed by <CTRL @>. This will place a NULL (ASCII 0) character in your text.
Please see the discussion of the Literal command in this section.


QUESTION:   How can I draw boxes in QEdit?

ANSWER:     Use the ToggleBoxDraw command (our default <SHIFT F1>). When box
drawing mode is on, a "B" will be present in the Status line. You can now use
the cursor keys to draw boxes in your text. To turn box drawing off, issue the
ToggleBoxDraw command again. The "B" will be gone from the status line. You
can also select several Box Styles, plus an eraser mode, by using the
ToggleBoxType command (our default <ALT F1>).


QUESTION:   I try to enter an ASCII 240 using the Alt numeric keypad and my
system seems to hang. What can I do?

ANSWER:     There is a "Known" problem with some versions of the Phoenix Bios
that occurs when an ASCII 240 is being generated from the numeric keypad and
"Enhanced Keyboard" calls are being made.

Internally, the bios code enters an infinite loop. To break out of this loop,
Press <CTRL BREAK> and you will again have control of your keyboard. *NOTE:
<CTRL C> will NOT get you out of the loop, you must use <CTRL BREAK>. If you
have enhanced keyboard testing turned off in QEdit, you will not have this
problem.

As a side note, DOS 4.0 and above also make enhanced keyboard calls and the
above discussion applies there as well.


QUESTION:   How can I change all the Tab characters in a file to spaces?

ANSWER:     Use the TabsToSpaces command (<Esc><O><X>)



 FINDING TEXT

QUESTION:   How can I limit a "FIND" or "SEARCH and REPLACE" operation to a
specified area?

ANSWER:     The "L" option was added as a way for the user to limit a search
operation to within a marked block area. When prompted for options, just
include "L" with the other options.


QUESTION:   How can I do a Find and place the found item on the center of the
screen.

ANSWER:     Set the "Center Finds" option on (<Esc><S><C>)



 CURSOR MOVEMENT
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


QUESTION:   When I use the cursor key in QEdit to move to the right or left,
the cursor stays on the same line when I come to the beginning or end of the
line. How can I have the cursor move to the start of the next line when I
reach the end of the current line OR move to the end of the previous line when
I reach the beginning of the current line?

ANSWER:     Assign the following macro in your Qconfig.dat file:

cursorleft  MacroBegin CursorLeft JTrue end: CursorUp JFalse end: EndLine end:

cursorright MacroBegin IsEndLine JTrue down: CursorRight Jump end: down:
    CursorDown JFalse end: BegLine end:


QUESTION:   When I am inserting text on a line, wordwrap does not seem to
work.

ANSWER:     In order for wordwrap to operate, the cursor has to exceed the
right margin that has been set. Once the right margin has been exceeded and
you type a non-wordset character, the line will wrap.


 PRINTER
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


QUESTION:   How can I enter Printer control codes in QEdit?

ANSWER:     Please see the TEXT ENTRY AND MANIPULATION section. You will need
to know the ASCII values of the control characters. These values will be
mentioned in your printer manual.


QUESTION:   I print a file that I have in QEdit, but the Box drawing
characters do not print on my printout.

ANSWER:     Check your printer manual and make sure that you have the printer
set up to utilize the Character Graphics Set.


QUESTION:   How can I have QEdit print to LPT2 or Com1?

ANSWER:     Set the appropriate print device via the QCONFIG program, or set
it interactively via the Print pulldown menu.


QUESTION:   How can I get double spaced lines on my printout?

ANSWER:     You can use the "print left margin" setting to obtain double and
triple spaced text in most cases. If you have your printer set up so that it
prints 80 characters on a line, then set the "print left margin" in QEdit to
80. This will cause QEdit to send 80 spaces before printing each line, so
effectively get double spaced lines. If you want triple spacing, then make the
setting 160.


QUESTION:   I have QEdit sending formfeeds to the printer, but am getting
parts of a page AND some blank pages on my printout.

ANSWER:     Make sure that your text does not have some long lines that are
being wrapped by the printer. If your printer wraps at 80 characters on a
line, make sure that your file does not have lines longer than 80 characters.


 CONFIGURATION
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


QUESTION:   I make some changes to QEdit using Qconfig.exe and they do not
take effect.

ANSWER:     Make sure that you are using the copy of QEdit that you just
configured. If you are not in the current directory where your newly
configured copy of QEdit is, then check your path to see if you are getting a
different copy of QEdit. Be sure to look for batch files as well as EXE's and
COM's that share the same primary name. I.E. Look for Q.exe, Q.com, Q.bat
along your path.


 QEDIT COMMANDS
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


QUESTION:   When I use the CenterLine command, my text is not centered on the
screen.

ANSWER:     The centerline command uses column 1 and the right margin that you
have set as the basis for centering text. If you want the text centered on the
screen, assuming that your screen is 80 columns wide, you can set your right
margin to 80 and then issue the centerline command. If you don't want to
change your right margin, you can use column block marking to mark your left
and right hand margins, then issue the centerline command.


QUESTION:   How do I get the Sort command to work?

ANSWER:     In order to use the Sort command, you must be in a single,
nonzoomed window. You must use the MarkColumn command to mark the range of
lines to sort, and the width of the field to sort on as the key. If you use
any other type of blocking, the sort command will not work.

QUESTION:   How can I have QEdit run a macro on start-up?

ANSWER:     The "-Emacroname" or "/Emacroname" command line switch, will
execute the first macro in macroname. Be sure to specify a path to macroname
if it is not in the current directory. E.G.  Q ABC -Ec:\path\mymacro.mac will
load file ABC and execute the first macro in c:\path\mymacro.mac. Please note
that this switch does not load macroname. If you also want to load macroname,
then use the -L or /L option described in this section.


QUESTION:   How can I have QEdit pre-load a macro set?

ANSWER:     The "-Lmacroname" or "/Lmacroname" command line switch, will load
macroname. Be sure to specify a path to macroname if it is not in the current
directory. E.G.  Q ABC -Lc:\path\mymacro.mac will load file ABC and load the
macrofile c:\path\mymacro.mac.


QUESTION:   I used to be able to have QEdit load a file and then go to a
certain line number, but now it does not work.

ANSWER:     In versions of QEdit prior to version 2.1, going to a specified
line on startup was a configuration program option. This has been replaced
with a command line switch of the format -nLINE# or /nLINE#. I.E. To load file
ABC and immediately go to line# 35 type:  Q ABC -n35


QUESTION:   How can I have QEdit come up in 43/50 line mode?

ANSWER:     Set the appropriate option via the QCONFIG program.  See the
Colors/Screen section.


QUESTION:   How do I use a QEdit command that is not tied to a key?

ANSWER:     If you would like to have the command available at all times, just
assign the command to a key in your keyboard definition file. Once you have
modified your keyboard file, be sure to run the Qconfig.exe program. Select
the Keys option, supply the name of your Keyboard file, then save your changes
and quit the program.

You may use all the QEdit commands when creating macros.
